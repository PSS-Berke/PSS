    "company_background": "Subway is a global quick-service restaurant (QSR) chain focused on made-to-order sandwiches, salads, wraps, bowls, catering and digital ordering. It operates roughly ~37,000 restaurants worldwide with a large but contracting U.S. footprint (~19,500 U.S. locations as of year-end 2024). The brand is positioned as a global sandwich leader by unit count and is executing modernization (store remodels, digital enhancements) to improve franchisee economics and growth prospects.",

    "recent_news_initiatives": "Key developments (2023–2025): Roark Capital completed acquisition in April 2024; Fresh Forward 2.0 store remodel program and large-scale digital investments (kiosks, KDS, app/loyalty) have been prioritized, with 20,000+ Fresh Forward builds/remodels noted by end of 2024; leadership transitions include interim CEO activity and the appointment of Jonathan Fitzpatrick as CEO effective July 28, 2025. Strategy emphasis: 'Smart Growth' optimizing U.S. footprint while pursuing international master-franchise expansion and nontraditional locations (retail partners, travel centers, campuses).",
    "potential_pain_points": "1) U.S. footprint contraction and pressure on franchisee profitability. 2) Franchisee relations and need to boost unit-level economics amid remodel costs. 3) Complex execution of large-scale remodels (logistics, supply chain, installers, downtime). 4) Digital and systems integration challenges across varied franchisee tech readiness (POS, kiosks, KDS, loyalty). 5) Workforce/training consistency across formats and nontraditional venues. 6) Ensuring brand and supply-chain consistency while scaling international master-franchise deals.",
    "strategic_talking_points_for_sales_call": "1) Accelerate franchisee profitability: demonstrate concrete cost-savings and remodel payback timelines to ease franchisee investment concerns. 2) Improve digital order-to-kitchen throughput and accuracy: integrate with existing app/kiosk pilots to lift speed and average check. 3) De-risk Fresh Forward rollouts: offer a single-partner model for procurement, installers and local compliance to shorten downtime. 4) Enable Smart Growth & nontraditional formats: provide compact, consistent solutions for staffing, menu and fulfillment in campuses, travel centers and retail partners.",
    "suggested_value_propositions": "1) Remodel financing and turnkey retrofit programs to lower per-store capital burden and accelerate payback. 2) End-to-end digital integration (ordering → KDS → fulfillment → analytics) that minimizes custom IT work for franchisees. 3) Franchisee enablement platforms for training, labor optimization and standardized operations to raise service consistency. 4) Project and supply-chain orchestration (procurement bundles, vetted installer networks, modular kits) to reduce downtime and cost overruns. 5) Data-driven loyalty and personalization services to increase frequency and check.",
    "call_action_plan": "Opening (1–2 min): Quick intro and 3 credibility facts; state purpose: accelerate remodel ROI, simplify tech rollouts, and boost franchisee profitability. Discovery (8–12 min): Ask which metrics define Fresh Forward success, primary franchisee pain points, current tech stack (POS, KDS, loyalty), integration blockers, rollout timeline and financing constraints. Value pitch (6–8 min): Present tailored ROI slide, relevant case examples, integration approach and a low-risk pilot proposal. Handle objections (3–5 min): Address cost, franchisee autonomy and integration risk with pilot, phased deployment and financing/revenue-share options. Next steps / Close (2–3 min): Request a defined DMA/cluster pilot, propose joint discovery with Damien Harmon/Ben Selden and a technical stakeholder, and commit to a 2–4 week pilot plan and cost estimate.",
    "preparation_tip": "1) Bring local unit economics and Fresh Forward penetration metrics to demonstrate urgency. 2) Lead with ROI: prepare conservative and aggressive payback scenarios for remodel + tech upgrades. 3) Map stakeholders: request engagement with Damien Harmon (North America), Ben Selden (CFO) and Greg Lyons (CMO) as appropriate. 4) Ask targeted discovery questions about franchisee concerns (cost, timeline, supply chain, tech integration) and be ready to propose a low-risk pilot."
