Notes

Session Management: The API handles session state automatically. Only one session can be active per user at a time.
Data Persistence: All messages and sessions are stored in the database. Sessions use soft delete (is_deleted flag).
Security: All endpoints require authentication and include user ownership checks where applicable.
Campaign Auto-Creation: The system automatically creates a "Single Posts" campaign if none exists when initiating a session.
Session ID Generation: If no session_id is provided, the system generates a random 15-character alphanumeric string.

This API provides a solid foundation for building AI-powered LinkedIn content creation tools with proper session management and conversation history.
